# MI_AI_5.1
Visulization on the basic principles of pandas and dataframes using python.

We are loading the Data Coupon.csv into the Pandas to identify the diffrent coupons that have been used.

we ceanled up the data, identified any with null and NAN data , replaced them with 0 
total nuber of records =12684
total number of colupons accpted = 5474

we ploted a bar plot of the coupon column
we ploted a histogram of the temperature column

weploted a histogram of the age column to identify all the diffrent age groups

#
Problem 1 
We started our analysis of all BAr coupons that were issued
Creating a new DAta frame "DataCoupon" to isolate all the records where coupon = Bar there were 2017 records who were given bar coupons.

we also created a new Dataframe where the number of bar visits were converted to int instead of an array.
the following conversion was used.
('less1',1)
('never',0)
('gt8',8)
('4~8',5)
('1~3',3)
Problem 2
we analysed the number of coupons that were accepted.

Problem 3

we ploted a count plot to find the number of ppl who accepted the coupon to the number of times they visited the bar.

problem 4 
 we ploted the graph to see the age of the ppl who accepted the coupon to the number of bar visits.

 Problem 5 

 compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry. 

 Problem 6 

 Compare the acceptance rates between those drivers who:
go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed OR
go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 OR
go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.
